Use this template if the code in main fails to build for you.  If your problem happens at runtime, please use the issue template `Runtime Crash` or the issue template `Runtime Bug`, as appropriate.

Please use a descriptive title. Include in the title the _first_ error message. Attach your buildlog if possible.

### Build Version
<!--
If you fetched the source from Git, state the Git commit you used, preferably as the full 40-digit commit hash.  Please do **not** say "HEAD", "current", or similar relative references.  
The meaning of relative references can change as contributors publish new code.  The 40-digit commit hash will not change.
